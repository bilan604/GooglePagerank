MAT167: 5/21/2022 - 5/28/2022  

The task for this project was to explain the Page Rank algorithm and why it works. To figure that out, I coded a way to calculate the page ranks and used the  Power and Dense methods as well.

Note: The teleportation (teleporting away) parameter got cut off in the screenshot for Figure 2. It should add (1-tp)/n on the last line. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook if replicating.
