MAT167: 5/21/2022 - 5/28/2022  

The goal of the project was to explaining the Google Pagerank algorithm and why it works. To figure that out, I coded a way to calculate the page ranks and used the  Power and Dense methods as well.

Note: The teleportation (teleporting away) parameter got cut off in the screenshot for Figure 2 + (1-tp)/n. Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
